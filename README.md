# Quizzical

A quiz game that gets questions by [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). Also you can choose spesific question by category segment to challenge yourself! This app made by me from scracth. Hope you enjoy!


This idea is from [Bob Ziroll's scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) and it was final project and **I MADE IT** :muscle:

Here is the link of the app https://quizzical-hkqa.onrender.com/
